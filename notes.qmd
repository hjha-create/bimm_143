## Using git

Git is a command line version control system. We can use it from Rstudio (via the "git pane" in the upper left) or from the command line (i.e in the terminal tab).

The steps to using git involve: 

- Initiate a git repository (aka start git)
  git init
  or click little box in RStudio

- Do your work (same as ever)
  add files, edit files, save files etc
  
- **Add files you care about to the stage**
  Can do git add yourfilename
  click to add to **stage** in RStudio
  
- Final step is to **commit your changes**
  git commit -m "your wee message"
  click "commit" button in RStudio
